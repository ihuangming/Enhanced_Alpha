# Instructions
Each problem consists of a function to implement and instructions on how to implement the function. The parts of the function that need to be implemented are marked with a # TODO comment. After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our project_tests package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.

# Packages
When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like Pandas and Numpy. These packages will be imported for you. We recommend you don't add any import statements, otherwise the grader might not be able to run your code.

The other packages that we're importing are project_helper and project_tests. These are custom packages built to help you solve the problems. The project_helper module contains utility functions and graph functions. The project_tests contains the unit tests for all the problems.
